# Goldfishr

Goldfishr helps you test your Magic: The Gathering decks by providing an opponent which will handle its own turns.

Some interaction is required in order to advance the opponent's phases, but it will cast its own spells, tap its creatures to attack.

Goldfishr has a built-in life counter which can automatically subtract life if Goldfishr's creatures aren't marked as blocked.
