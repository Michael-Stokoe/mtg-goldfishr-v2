                <span class="font-beleren">Goldfishr</span> is the easiest way to test your decks' mettle. It will handle
                its own turns, casting
                spells and moving to combat, declare attackers, etc.
            </p>
            <p>We have a built-in life counter which will automatically deduct life lost from unblocked attackers and any
                spells
                cast by the opponent.</p>

                two
                done soon!</p>
